# FizzBuzz

This repository contains a simple implementation of the FizzBuzz problem in Python. The FizzBuzz problem is a common coding challenge often used in programming interviews and exercises.

## Problem Statement

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to `n`. However, for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## Implementation

The implementation of FizzBuzz in this repository is written in Javascript. The code iterates through numbers from 1 to 100 and applies the FizzBuzz logic as described above.
