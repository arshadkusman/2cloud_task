# TASK 1
# FizzBuzz

This repository contains a simple implementation of the FizzBuzz problem in javascript. The FizzBuzz problem is a common coding challenge often used in programming interviews and exercises.

## Problem Statement

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to `n`. However, for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

# TASK 2
# Fibonacci sequence using recursion

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Fibonacci sequence using recursion in javascript. The problem is a common coding challenge often used in programming interviews and exercises.

## Problem Statement

Write a JavaScript function using recursion to print the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.  
The function should be recursive and must have steps taken to avoid infinite loops
